## What is the purpose of a Marine Protected Area?

Marine Protected Areas (or MPAs) endeavor to protect marine life and crucial marine habitats for both their intrinsic and cultural values. While MPAs are discrete geographic regions characterized by regulations limiting or entirely preventing human interaction, they support a wide array of organisms that may be transient between multiple areas (protected or non).

Desires to protect or preserve local fisheries often play a major role in motivating MPA development. As a result, fishery species biomass is of special interest to policy makers, who allocate funds and advise the management of these areas. 

As of 2025, MPA networks are utilized worldwide, but there is no unified methodology for determining how MPAs affect key species biomass. This is due in part to the difficulty in establishing a counterfactual that MPA sites can be compared to, in order to ascertain the trajectory of key species biomass in the absence of MPA establishment in these areas. 

MPA boundaries are often selected to encompass specific biota and biodiversity, and thus are not randomly selected. Since marine monitoring and research is time consuming and costly, it is highly unlikley that there will be legacy monitoring of a region before it becomes an MPA.

However, there have been some promising frameworks proposed that utilized sites with legacy monitoring to test the validity of their proposed designs.

## How can we measure their effectiveness?

In the paper "Integrating impact evaluation in the design and implementation of monitoring marine protected areas" by Ahmadiyya et al. 2015 [^1], the researchers suggested that proposed sites should be randomly selected and monitored before the time of MPA establishment, to act as counterfactuals for future analysis of MPA effectiveness. If this were not possible with time constraints, then control sites should be randomly selected and paired to MPA sites before establishment and continually be monitored. They stated that a wide array of environmental and anthropogenic factors should be monitored in both the control and MPA sites to better evaluate each system, their sentiments best stated in the quote: 

"To inform decisions about MPA placement, design and implementation, we need to expand our understanding of conditions under which MPAs are likely to lead to positive outcomes by embracing advances in impact evaluation methodologies" (Ahmadiyya et al. 2015)

They then proposed using a coarse and statistical matching with a *Difference-in-Difference (DiD)* method for analyzing key fisheries species biomass, as well as functional species biomass (herbivorous fish that maintain the reef) between sites. After this, their main objective was to utilize a *hierarchical mixed effects model* would be used to determine how each variable contributes to key species biomass, and how they interact with one another.

To demonstrate the application of this framework, they decided to select a pre-existing MPA site with a plethora of monitoring data, Bird's Head Seascape in Indonesia, and "reverse engineer" counterfactual sites in order to run *DiD* and *hierarchical mixed effects models*. 

This was accomplished via the selection of 10 primary covariates, selected by local researchers and reef specialists, comprehensive literature reviews, and determining what aligned with available data. The researchers affirmed that their covariates "
The final covariates were determined to encompass “structural, biophysical, and social features of coral-reef sites that influence ecosystem structure”. 


## Difference-in-Difference (DiD)

A type of *"Before-After Control-Impact" (BACI)* analysis with an ecological focus, a *Difference-in-Difference* study leverages time trends when random assignment is not possible. Essentially, you can compare the same site before and after the implementation of the treatment to determine if it had any effect. *DiD* studies often use a linear regression to accomplish this.

A couple of the key assumptions made in using this model are :

1. The baseline outcome would have persisted unchanged over time

2. Parallel trends exist pre-treatment


This process involves both coarse and statistical matching. *Coarse matching* involves grouping the sites by common physical, chemical, and ecological attributes by researchers, informed by experts in coral reef ecology (reefs with similar coral diversity, similar wave action, reef type, etc.). *Statistical matching* involves utilizing a
