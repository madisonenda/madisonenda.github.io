## About the Thomas Fire

Part of a string of devastating wildfires that tore through southern California in December of 2017, the Thomas Fire is widely agreed to be one of the largest in California history. Damaging or completely destroying approximately 3,137 structures over the course of 39 days[^1], the cause of the fire was determined to be downed power lines[^2] due to strong winds. 

A major anthropogenic disaster like the Thomas Fire initiates a cascade of environmental, ecological, and social damages, the extent to which is monitored via large-scale interdisciplinary projects. A key component of the aforementioned process is geospatial analysis of the fire torn region, including the land and atmosphere directly affected by the burn. 

In this post, we will walk through a couple examples of preliminary damage assessment using data provided by CAL FIRE, NASA and USGS's Landsat 8 satellite [^3], and data analysis methods developed by the Master's of Environmental Data Science program at the University of California, Santa Barbara [^4].
