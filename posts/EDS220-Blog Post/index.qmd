## About the Thomas Fire

Part of a string of devastating wildfires that tore through southern California in December of 2017, the Thomas Fire is widely agreed to be one of the largest in California history. It damaged or completely destroyed approximately 3,137 structures over the course of 39 days[^1]. The cause of the fire was determined to be downed power lines[^2] due to strong winds.

A major anthropogenic disaster like the Thomas Fire initiates a cascade of environmental, ecological, and social damages, the extent to which is monitored via large-scale interdisciplinary projects. A key component of the aforementioned process is geospatial analysis of the fire torn region, including the land and atmosphere directly affected by the burn.

In this post, we will walk through a couple examples of preliminary damage assessment using data provided by CAL FIRE, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)[^3], NASA and USGS's Landsat 8 satellite [^4], and data analysis methods developed by the Master's of Environmental Data Science program at the University of California, Santa Barbara [^5].

Utilizing Air Quality Index (AQI) data provided by the Environmental Protection Agency, we can assess how the smoke and other air borne particles suspended in the low atmosphere (as a result of the Thomas Fire) affected air quality during the incident. Similarly, by comparing AQI data from before and after the fire, we can form a rough estimate of how much air borne pollution was contributed overall.

Using satellite raster data on specific wavelengths of light reflected off the surface of the earth, we can establish which colors in the visible spectrum are represented most in sampled regions (red, blue, green). The reflectance of specific wavelengths of light indicates substrate type ( vegetation, soil, pavement, etc.) and this information will allow us to identify regions that were burned during the Thomas Fire, i.e. changed from vegetation to scorched land.

From this, we can create true color maps of a sampled area ( red corresponds to red, blue to blue, etc.), or, using near-infrared or short-wave infrared wavelength information, could utilize other colors to best contrast fire scars in the region. We will use both of these methods to assess the spatial extent of the 2017 Thomas Fire damage.

## Assessing Air Quality Index After the Fire

We start off loading in our libraries for all the notebooks, and loading in the data as variables with intuitive names ('aqi' for Air Quality Index, and the 17 or 18 for the year 2017 or 2018)

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("packages.png")
```

Next, we need to combine our 2017 and 2018 data sets by stacking them, using the pd.concat() function

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("AQI_final.png")
```

We now have one cohesive data set. We can make it easier to work with as well, by setting a uniform standard for column naming.

For this task, we use str.lower() chained with str.replace(), to set all the names to lowercase and replace spaces with underscores.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("Code_Chunk3.png")
```

After our names have been made uniform and easier to call, we can filter the data set to our area of interest (Santa Barbara for the area of the Thomas Fire), and then drop all columns related to location identity, ('county_name', 'state_code', etc.) to omit redundancies.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("AQI_pic3.png")
```

Next, working with the dates...

In Python, a lot of the trickiness of working with dates can be alleviated using the function pd.to_datetime() and providing the column of dates you wish to convert. Unlike other coding languages/interfaces, pandas already has a library of potential date formats it compares your data to, and matches it to any stored in its data base.

Once that's done, we can set our date column to be our index for easy identification of the observations.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("AQI_pic4.png")
```

In order to have a metric to compare the AQI to before, during, and after the fire, we need to take averages. However, just taking the average of the three aforementioned instances doesn't allow for pattern or trend observation with much certainty.

Instead, we will use a 5-day rolling average to hopefully better identify the trend of AQI from the fire. To do this, we will chain the .rolling() and .mean() functions.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("AQI_pic5.png")
```

Then we create a new column for this averaged data using the .assign() function.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("AQI_pic6.png")
```

And now the fun part!

We get to plot the lines of the AQI over time in Santa Barbara, using the exact values and the 5-day rolling average.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("AQI_pic7.png")
```

We can clearly see a big spike in trend lines, which corresponds to a huge increase in air pollution around the time of the fire, that decreases over the course of a couple months (which is easier to see using the 5-day average).

## Identifying the Thomas Fire Perimeter

To create a true color or false color image of the affected area, we will first need an outline of the extent of the Thomas Fire that we can clip raster data to.

Here is how we can use historical fire data from CAL FIRE to create that boundary.

To start, we will load in our boundary data as a variable called 'fire_perimeters', since it is not yet filtered to only the Thomas Fire.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("fire_peri_2.png")
```

In order to filter the data, we have to specify both the location (Santa Barbara) and the year (2017), as there unfortunately have been multiple major fires in the Santa Barbara county area, and many other fires that occurred that year.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("fire_peri_3.png")
```

Alright, we now have the boundary of the specific fire we are looking for! We can take a look at the shape of the boundary with a very quick plot. The warning lets us know that there is a new way of specifying geometry type when plotting spatial data, but that doesn't affect what we are looking for here.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("fire_peri_4.png")
```

Now that we've confirmed the boundary is proper, we can save this file for use in our next map, using 'name.to_file()'

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("fire_peri_5.png")
```

We may receive a warning that let's us know that column names may be shorted in the Shapefile, but don't worry, as it won't affect anything we've done.

## False Color Image of Fire Scars

With our 2017 Thomas Fire Perimeter, we can now utilize the Landsat 8 satellite data to create rasters that show different types of substrate over the area the fire occurred.

The Landsat 8 satellite measures a multitude of radiance wavelengths, but we are mainly interested in red band, blue band, green band, near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR22) data.

The data set consists of only one band, with float64 x and y coordinates and our 5 main variables of interest are identified as: - red (red band with wavelengths 0.64-0.67 micrometers),

-   green (green band with wavelengths 0.53-0.59 micrometers),

-   blue (blue band with wavelengths 0.45-0.51 micrometers),

-   nir08 (near-infrared band with wavelengths 0.85-0.88 micrometers),

-   swir22 (shortwave infrared band with wavelengths from 2.11-2.29 micrometers) .

We begin by, once again, assigning the data to a variable. However, in this instance our data set consists of layered rasters, which is kept in the 'xarray' format. Thus, we will now begin working with the 'Rioxarray' package we loaded in earlier. This package helps us more easily sift through bands, letting us use only the wavelengths we want for each type of image.

We will also use os to create a file path to our data.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("scars_2.png")
```

Now we can use that file path to load in our data, and assign it to a variable called 'landsat'

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("fire_scars2.png")
```

Because there is only one band, we can drop the band information, as it is a redundancy, using .squeeze() to remove the length, and .drop_vars() to remove the band.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("scars_3.png")
```

With the band dimension dropped, lets make our first map!

For a true color image, we will assign the red, green, and blue bands to their corresponding colors. By specifying that 'robust' = True in the plot.imshow() function, we ensure that the colors are represented appropriately.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("scars_4.png")
```

Let's contrast this model with a false color one, where the scars from the fire, typically displayed in brown in a true color image, will now be displayed in red. This will make it easier to analyze the extent of the fire damage.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("scars_5.png")
```

The damaged area from the Thomas Fire can be seen much more clearly now! We can change the extent of the image to "zoom" in to the fire scars now.

First, we will have to load in our fire boundary from earlier. After matching the coordinate reference systems of the data (CRS), we can create the false color image clipped to the extent of the Thomas Fire perimeter.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("scars_6.png")
```

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("fire_scars6.png")
```

Then we can plot the raster again and examine our area of interest...

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("scars_7.png")
```

The fire scars are bright red now, and contrast quite well against the rest of the landscape. Using the bounds of the Thomas Fire perimeter, we can set the boundary to our area of interest and "zoom" in on the scars.

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("scars_8.png")
```

Finally...we have a simple map of the extent of the 2017 Thomas Fire Damage!

```{r, out.width="2000px", fig.align= 'center'}
#| echo: false 
knitr::include_graphics("scars_9.png")
```
