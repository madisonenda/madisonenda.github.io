## Hi there! Thanks for Stopping by :)

My name is Madison Elisabeth Enda, and I am a 23-year-old aspiring biological oceanographer and ecologist from Los Angeles, CA. Ultimately, my goal is to preserve and protect coastal environments across the globe. I am particularly interested in analyzing the effects of nutrient pollution on coral reef ecosystems through statistical modeling, in order to define how certain stressors influence population structure and to predict the rate of evolutionary adaptation in marine foundation species.

Today, I am actively looking to participate in coastal restoration work, and eventually join a lab working in predictive modeling and/or the analysis of the physiological effects major environmental stressors incur on foundation species within coastal zones.
